# City Search Problem 

These project resolves City Search Problem using searching graph algorithms that optimitize
the path cost from one city to another. We have included a graph whose nodes are Romania's cities
in order to illustrate how the code works, but you can try other instances. Furthermore, the
main execution of this program returns the minimum path for some cities from Romania, as well as
how many nodes have been expanded during the search.

## Search Strategies

- Breadth first graph search (BFS)
- Depth first graph search (DFS)
- Branch and bound graph search (BBS)
- Branch and bound with subestimation graph search (BBES)

## Comparison of expanded nodes between BBS and BBES

BB Search | BBE Search
------|-------
n1 | n2
n2 | n3
n4 | n5
n6 | n7
n8 | n9
